Name:Shwetanshu Giri      
Company:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS    
Intern ID:CT4DS2909    
Domain:Data Science     
Duration:June to July 2024     
Mentor:Neelam Harish     

Objectives:    
Implement a Simple Linear Regression Model: Create and train a linear regression model using a sample dataset.    
Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the accuracy of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.   
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.    
Visualize Results: Plot the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to visually assess the model's performance.   


Key Points:       
Data Creation: Generated a synthetic dataset with a clear linear relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable y.   
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.     
Model Training: Trained a linear regression model using the training data.       
Model Evaluation: Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics to evaluate the model's performance.     
Visualization: Created visual plots to compare the model's predictions with actual values, including the regression line and actual vs. predicted scatter plot.    

Technologies Used:   
Python: Programming language used to implement the linear regression model.      
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.     
Pandas: Used to handle and manipulate the dataset.       
Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing the data and results.    
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, prediction, and evaluation.     

Key Insights:    
Linear Relationship: The dataset used has a clear linear relationship, making it suitable for simple linear regression.    
Model Performance: The model's performance can be quantified using MSE and R-squared metrics. Lower MSE and higher R-squared values indicate a better fit.     
Visualization: Visual plots help in understanding how well the model fits the data and how accurate the predictions are. The regression line plot shows the overall fit, while the actual vs. predicted scatter plot reveals the model's accuracy and any potential deviations.  Training and Testing: Splitting the data into training and testing sets ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data, providing a better estimate of its real-world performance.
